## Description

During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, as people across the globe faced challenges in keeping track of the evolving situation, this project was developed to provide comprehensive, real-time updates on the virus's spread. This data analytics solution is built on Excel, Pivot Tables, and Macros, leveraging data from the John Hopkins University database and other reliable sources endorsed by the World Health Organization. 

The goal of the software is to automatically pull updates of COVID-19 cases from around the world and analyze them into visually comprehensible charts and graphs. This means that even before local TV stations in Ghana can announce the updates, our dashboard will have the information readily available. 

## Features
- Real-time data updates from reliable sources.
- Data analysis presented through easily understandable charts and graphs.
- Automatic data pulling and visualization.
